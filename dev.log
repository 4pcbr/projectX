Log: Another attempt to fix the links problem. It seems fixQualifiedLibraryPaths is
not compatible with the recent raspberrian release. Pushed some fixed sed
rewrite rules. make is in progress.

qtbase finally built. I also built webkit, but the original folder was empty,
so I simply cloned the repo into qt5 folder:
git clone git://code.qt.io/qt/qtwebkit.git

WebKit requires sqlite so one has to export the lib explicitly:
export SQLITE3SRCDIR=~/opt/qt5/qtbase/src/3rdparty/sqlite

it also needs an explicit rootfolder env:
export PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR=/mnt/rasp-pi-rootfs/usr/lib/pkgconfig

Some packages were missing:
sudo apt-get install gperf bison flex

then launched the helper script:
./Tools/Scripts/build-webkit --qmake=/usr/local/qt5pi/bin/qmake --qt --release --no-webgl
Node the qmake path -- if it's not provided the script will use the system qmake
instead.
